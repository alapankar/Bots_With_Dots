>Doctogram- a smart disease prediction app built using ML that predicts disease based on the symptoms given by user.

# Problem Statement
These days there are too many tools for “Disease Prediction”. But the apps mainly focus on the heart diseases that have been analyzed. But there are no apps that are used for the prediction of general diseases. Moreover, if there are such applications which do predict diseases, the accuracy factor is still not up to the mark. So Doctogram does successful analysis by generating meaningful patterns from structured and unstructured data from the information presented by the patients and helps for the prediction of the general diseases absolutely free of cost.
